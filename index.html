 <p><b>Hello my name is ESTHER RATA, I am 24 years old ,currently live in Ma'le Adummim, Israel<br>
 In 2005 i made Aliy'a from ETHIOPIA with my familay to Kiryat Yam city,<br> there we learn hebrew in the Olpan for one year,
 after we all pass the tests we move to MA'le Adummim</b></p>
 
 <p><i><b>During the Corona period I was a lot at home without a job<br>
 so I came up with the idea of starting a small invitations business for all types of events <br>
 Even though there were no events at all, I started designing event invitations,<br>
 Different designs Because I knew that once the corona was over there would be a lot of events <br>
so i prepared my self with some  design invitations to show to the client</i></b></p><br>
